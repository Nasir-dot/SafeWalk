# 🛡️ SafeWalk – Your Digital Companion for Night Safety

**SafeWalk** is more than just a project — it's a small step toward making people feel safer when walking alone at night.

Built during a late-night brainstorm with our team (*Frontline Coders*), this web app empowers users in distress with quick access to essential tools like live location sharing, SOS alerts, flashlight mode, and a loud alarm — all packed in a lightweight, privacy-focused interface.

## 💡 Why We Built It

We wanted to solve a real-world problem — the discomfort and danger that many people, especially women, face when alone at night. The idea was to create something simple, fast, and accessible from any browser — no downloads, no sign-ups.

With **SafeWalk**, one tap can send a help message, trigger an alarm, or show the user’s live location.

## 🔧 What’s Inside?

- 📍 **Live Location Tracking**  
  Uses the browser's Geolocation API to pinpoint your real-time location.

- 🚨 **One-Tap SOS Message**  
  Sends a pre-filled SMS message for immediate help.

- 🔦 **Flashlight Mode**  
  A quick-bright screen to illuminate your surroundings or signal for help.

- 🔊 **Loud Alarm Sound**  
  Alerts people nearby or scares off threats.

- 🧠 **Emergency Tips**  
  Quick advice when you need to stay calm and act fast.

- 🌙 **Dark UI Theme**  
  Prevents the user from being easily noticed in dark surroundings.
